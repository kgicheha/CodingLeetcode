'''
Given an array of positive integers, find the smallest subarrayâ€™s
length whose sum of elements is greater than a given number k.


Example:

Input:  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, k = 20
Output: The smallest subarray length is 3
Explanation: The smallest subarray with sum > 20 is {6, 7, 8}

GIVEN:
    array of integers
    k number
STEPS:
    initiliaze left and right pointers to 0
    initialize min length that've seen so far
    initialize windowSum to 0
    smallest_sub_arry =[]

    loop through given array:
        add current element to the window sum

        while (window sum > target) and (left pointer <= right pointer):

            inilitialize current window size equal to (right pointer - left pointer + 1)


            if min_length == 0:
                set min length = current window size
                smallest_sub_arry = arr from left to right pointer
            elif min_length > current window size:
                min_length = current window size
                smallest_sub_arry = arr from left to right pointer

            reduce the size of the window by:
                removing the value in the left pointer from the window sum
                incrementing left pointer by 1

    return min_length

RESULT:
    smallest subarray length whose sum of elements is > than k
