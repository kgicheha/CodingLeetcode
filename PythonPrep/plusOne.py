You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits,
where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer.
The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant
in left-to-right order.
The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

EXAMPLE:

Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
